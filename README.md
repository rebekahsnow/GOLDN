# GOLDN

GOLDN is my senior capstone project aimed at solving 2 problems 

Problem #1 - Many affordable/new photographers do not have information available to the client upfront. This results in the client needing to message each photographer inquiring about pricing and availability.

Problem #2 - There is not one central location where clients can compare photographers side by side when it comes to all of the factors they may consider before booking (price, location, availability, and quality/style).


## Key Features

- **Account Registration:** Photographer's can upload all information a client would need before booking an appointment with them. Such as pricing/packages, location, image portfolio, types of service (wedding, portrait, family etc.).
- **Photographer Search:** Clients can search by budged, location, and type of service for photographers who have registered their information onto the database.  
- **Photographer Portfolio:** Based off of search results the client can see more informatin about the photographer. 

## Future Features

- **Scheduling:** Calendar system to show availability for the photographer
- **Chat:** Messaging capabilities between client and photographer
- **Account creation for clients:** Clients can save their favorite photographers onto their account Ability for clients to leave reviews for photographers they've hired
-**Reviews:** Ability for clients to leave reviews for photographers they've hired
